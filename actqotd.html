		Step One: Competitive Research, Brainstorming, & Wireframes
		<br><br>
		<p> Researched competing products' UX and content. Compiled similar products to gain an understanding of their designs and product features. This research was utilized in building the creative brief for the product. Based on this, I started with simple wireframes I created by hand and using balsamiq.  </p>

		Step Two: Initial Designs
