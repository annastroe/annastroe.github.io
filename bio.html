	<p> 
	I am a student at Tufts University, studying Cognitive and Brain Science with a concentration in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in human-centered design, user interface design, and user experience, and hope to use my knowledge of human cognition to improve technology and other products. My study of the brain has lead me to an interest in Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality as well. </br>
	I was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, and now live in the Bay Area, California. These two homes lend to my unique perspective in design and in my life in general - a perspective that fuses the functional with the creative, and the minimalistic with the technologically advanced. </br>
	In my free time, I love to paint portraits, hike in the California mountains, read Murakami novels and Oliver Sacks books, cook vegetarian recipes, and work on random projects with my friends. </br>
