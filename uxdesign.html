	<div id="description">
		<p> UX Design and Web Design allow me to meld my artistic sensibilities and love for visual design with my studies in cognitive neuroscience (how people think, behave and interact with technology) and my penchant towards building things and solving problems.
<br><br>
From learning c++, html/css & javascript in school, to playing around in Sketch and Photoshop for personal projects, to working on search engine optimization and ux design at Chegg Inc., I’ve developed a love for building and improving websites, user interfaces, and creative products. ultimately, i hope to create meaningful products and experiences that can improve people’s lives, from everyday online experiences to larger global issues

	<div id= "qotdtext">
		<p> Design of a product which delivers daily sample ACT questions, as well as archived practice questions organized by topic. I worked on each step of the design process, from competitive research, to wireframes, to numerous iterations of designs and layouts. I focused on utilizing SEO strategies (such as internal linking and indexation), as well as cohesive design elements to integrate the product with the rest of the site. The designs were to be used as a template for all future SEO-focused content.

	<div id= "snackstext">
		<p> An interactive page which allows users to find recipes and ideas which fit their tastes/moods by sorting based on user-selected filters. For this project I wrote copy text, researched and selected content (recipes), and designed the user interface. The main goal of this project was creating an engaging user experience to increase time on site, quality content, and external linking.
